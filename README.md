## ðŸ”Ž Reflection

### 1. Client & Scope  
- **Client:** Artemis Financial â€“ a consultancy offering savings, retirement, investment, and insurance solutions.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  1. **Vulnerability Assessment** of their public web interface (Project One)  
  2. **Secure Software Report** outlining back-end hardening techniques (Project Two)

---

### 2. Key Wins & Business Value  
- **Deep Dive Analysis:** Uncovered input-validation gaps, insecure data storage, and weak encryption.  
- **Business Impact:** Strengthened user trust, reduced breach risk, and ensured compliance with industry standards.

---

### 3. Challenges & Takeaways  
- **Biggest Hurdle:** Modeling complex user flows into a structured threat framework.  
- **Lesson Learned:** Even small omissionsâ€”such as absent rate limitingâ€”can create critical vulnerabilities.

---

### 4. Defense-in-Depth & Next Steps  
**Implemented Layers:**  
- OS hardening (CIS benchmarks)  
- API rate limiting & WAF  
- End-to-end TLS  

**Future Enhancements:**  
- CI/CD integration of automated scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP)  
- Formal STRIDE-based threat modeling  
- Periodic red-team assessments

---

### 5. Validation & Quality Assurance  
1. **Unit & Integration Tests:** Confirmed correct functionality across edge cases.  
2. **Fuzz Testing:** Identified unexpected input handling issues.  
3. **Static Analysis (SonarQube):** Verified no new security gaps after refactoring.

---

### 6. Tools & Best Practices  
- **Standards:** OWASP Top 10, SANS Secure Coding Guidelines  
- **Tooling:** Burp Suite, SonarQube, Git pre-commit hooks (ESLint, Bandit)  
- **Workflow:** Peer code reviews with a security checklist, automated CI/CD security scans

---

### 7. Showcase for Employers  
- **Vulnerability Assessment Report:** Demonstrates end-to-end risk analysis and remediation.  
- **Secure Software Report:** Highlights before/after code examples and applied mitigation techniques.

These artifacts collectively illustrate my ability to evaluate, document, and secure real-world applications from start to finish.
